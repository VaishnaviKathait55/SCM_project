<h3>Music Player<h3>

I have made an attractive music player using HTML and CSS. This project was a part of my Coding Ninja Course (Introduction to Web Technologies).
The website is completely responsive and made from scratch. 
You Can find the project live at : https://music-player-two-kohl.vercel.app/

This is how the project looks like:
